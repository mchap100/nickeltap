## Before You Start

<details>
<summary><strong>Before You Start</strong></summary>

- [ ] **What We're Building**  
  - A single web page with a button that's so satisfying to tap that people literally can't stop. The entire app is just three files that work together.

- [ ] **Tools You Need**  
  - A Replit account (free at replit.com)  
  - Your Chad Kroeger nickel image (named chad-nickel.png)  
  - A tap sound effect (named tap-sound.mp3)  
  - About 3 hours to build the basic version

- [ ] **The Three Files We'll Create**  
Your Replit Project/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (the page structure)
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css (how it looks)
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js (how it works)
â”œâ”€â”€ chad-nickel.png (your image)
â””â”€â”€ tap-sound.mp3 (your sound)
