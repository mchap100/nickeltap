NICKELTAP

A single-screen progressive web app that settles the Nickelback debate by tapping.
Users pick Team Love or Team Hate, smash the Chad Nickel button, and watch the global tally climb in real time.
Designed to be a perfect digital fidget toy: satisfying, addictive, and stupidly simple.

Platform: Progressive Web App (mobile-first, works everywhere)
Dev/Hosting: Replit (all-in-one hosting, backend, database)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Nickeltap gamifies a cultural debate with one mechanic: tap to vote. Users select Team Love or Team Hate and tap a silver nickel button featuring Chad Kroeger. Global team totals update smoothly. Built as a lightweight PWA with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Debate: The internet wants a definitive answer to the Nickelback question.
The Need: People want mindless, satisfying micro-interactions during boredom gaps.
The Gap: No app has turned a cultural debate into a simple, addictive tapping loop.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
Frontend:

Vanilla HTML, CSS, JS

PWA ready with manifest and service worker

localStorage for team, stats, and Legendary status

Backend:

Node.js with Express

API endpoints:

We do not track: personal data, analytics, cookies, accounts, or emails
Security: HTTPS only, rate limiting, sanitization, no user data surface

DEVELOPMENT PHASES
Phase 1: Static Prototype (local counters, button feel)
Phase 2: Live (backend, Replit DB, global counts, rate limiting)
Phase 3: Addiction Layer (escalating effects, rewards, Legendary status, sound, local records)
Phase 4: Polish (sharing, PWA install, performance optimization, cross-browser/device testing, launch)

PROJECT STRUCTURE
nickeltap/

index.html

style.css

script.js

chad-nickel.png

tap-sound.mp3
Phase 2 adds:

server.js

Replit DB entries

GETTING STARTED (REPLIT)
Phase 1:

Create new Repl with HTML/CSS/JS template

Add index.html, style.css, script.js, chad-nickel.png, tap-sound.mp3

Run project and confirm layout and tap feel

Phase 2:

npm init -y

npm install express

Add server.js with endpoints

Update Replit run command to "node server.js"

Frontend polls GET /api/counts every 2s and sends batched taps to POST /api/tapBatch

TESTING CHECKLIST

Tap squish is instant, no lag at 10 taps/sec

Team selection works and persists

Streak system and stage escalation messages appear at correct tap counts

Multiple browser tabs sync with same global totals

Mobile works: no scroll/zoom, haptics, sound unlocks on first tap

Share button works on mobile and desktop

RISK MITIGATION
Bot abuse: limited to 300/min/IP
Server overload: Replit autoscaling, upgrade to Postgres when needed
Team imbalance: UI messaging to encourage competition
Retention risk: Legendary status, personal bests, prestige loop
Mobile bugs: test early on physical devices
